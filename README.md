**_Terra_ provides various physics simulations, geological primitives, tesselations, filters, and more to generate realistic terrains.** (It's pretty bad right now but getting better!)

</div>

## Examples
![](docs/render_4.png)
**Example 1. Eroded Mountains.** The heightmap and colormap were generated with _Terra_ using the code below then exported and rendered in Blender. Fractal Perlin noise is used to generate the terrain. In order to make the terrain more mountain-like, a custom pointify filter is applied on every level of the Perlin noise. Lastly, we simulate 20,000 particles for hydraulic erosion.
```python
heightmap = pointy_perlin(X=600, Y=600, scale=100)
eroded_heightmap, path_map = erode(heightmap, num_iterations=20000)
export(heightmap, 'terrain.png', cmap='Greys_r')
export(eroded_heightmap, 'erosion.png', cmap='Greys_r')
export(eroded_heightmap, "erosion_color.png", cmap=terrain_cmap())
export(np.log1p(path_map), 'path_map.png', cmap='Blues')
```
As you can see, it only takes two lines to create the terrain! Everything else is just exporting the various maps that are generated. Below is a more simpler example showing some of the maps:

**Example 2. A Tiny Island.** Using fractal Perlin noise with the pointify effect at every level, a simple island can be generated effortlessly. The image here shows the heightmap, the colourmap, and normal map generated with _Terra_. 
```python
island = hill(500, 500)
export(island, "hill.png", cmap="Greys_r")
export(island, "hill_coloured.png", cmap=terrain_cmap())
export(normal_map(island), "hill_normal.png", cmap="viridis")
```

**Example 2. Map of a Continent with Various Biomes.** Tesselate the space using Voronoi cells. Create a heightmap using fractal Brownian noise. Create a temperature map using a slightly warped gradient with added Perlin noise, a precipation map created using Perlin noise. Classify the areas into biomes using a Whittaker diagram. Inspired by [Pvigier's Vagabond Map Generation](https://pvigier.github.io/2019/05/12/vagabond-map-generation.html). Rendered in [Blender](). 

```python
S = 42; X = 500; Y = 500
# Create the heightmap
tesselation = Voronoi(X, Y, density=0.001, relax=3, seed=S)
heightmap = perlin(X, Y, scale=150, octaves=1, seed=S)
heightmap = tess_heightmap(tesselation, shape=(X, Y), heightmap=heightmap)
heightmap = warp(heightmap, shape=(X, Y), warp_strength=20.0, seed=S+3)
heightmap = gaussian_blur(heightmap, sigma=2) + 0.5*perlin(X, Y, scale=50, octaves=4, seed=S+10)
# Create a linear temperature map and a precipitation map using Perlin noise
linear_tempmap = lingrad(X, Y, start=(X/2,0,30), end=(X/2,Y, -10))
temperaturemap = 30 - 25 * heightmap
precipationmap = 400 * perlin(X, Y, scale=500, octaves=2, seed=S+3)
# Create and save the biome map as a png file
biomemap = classify_biomes(temperaturemap, precipationmap)
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))
plt.imshow(biomemap, cmap=biome_cmap)
plt.axis('off') 
plt.savefig('biomemap.png', bbox_inches='tight', pad_inches=0, dpi=300)
plt.close()
# Export the heightmap as a png file
export(heightmap, 'heightmap.png', cmap='Greys_r', dpi=300)
```

## Get Started
Clone the repository or download it as a zip. Create or open a local Python environment (I recommend Anaconda) and install the dependencies `dependencies.txt`.

## ü§ùüèª Contribute
**There is much to do.** The plan:
1. Implement various terrain generation algorithms and tools quickly in Python.
2. Optimize the performance for real-time and large scales by improving the algorithms, using C, and the GPU.
3. Create a GUI interface.

 At this point, Terra is pretty much just educational. But it doesn't have to be. Leave your mark and add to this Python library. You know how it goes. You found a bug? Add an issue. Any ideas for improvement or feeling the need to add more features? Clone the repository, make the changes, and submit a pull request, or...
